#  The Game eXperience Engine: A simple game framework

##  What is this?
GXE is a simple game framework that is programmable in LUA that is meant to help people make games without the bloat of a game engine or the complexity of c++ and memory management. It has some simple but powerful functionality for making games (Like rendering and basic collision detection) but still has room so you can implment your own systems.

##  Isn't this just love2d?
At the current moment, yeah. It is basicly Love2d but diffrent. But I am hoping to change that. I want to implment some more game specific functionality (Built in A* pathfinding, tilemap loading, etc). What I am saying is that I want this to be more like flixel where it has a lot of game specifc functionality but is still bare bones enough to allow you to get your hands dirty.

##  Is this complete yet?
When was any open ~sause~ source project ever finished?

##  Todo
*  Built in collision response 
*  3d support (maybe)
*  Actually good examples
*  More basic shape rendering
*  Sound
*  Windows build
*  Actually good examples
*  Wiki
*  Documentation
*  ~Marry Jerma~
*  Make a website

##  How to build
*  First download MINGW and the [Allegro development binaries](https://liballeg.org/) for the compiler.
*  Put allegro_monolinth.dll into the root directory
*  Run make (or mingw32-make)
*  Pray
*  Run gxeruntime.exe
*  Or just ask me to build it for you though [email](mailto:michealtheratz@courvix.com)

##  Am I free to contribute?
Of course you are! Just fork the repository and make your changes. After you are done make sure to make a pull request.
