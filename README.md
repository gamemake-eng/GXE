#  The Game eXperience Engine: A simple game framework

##  What is this?
GXE is a simple game framework that is programmable in LUA that is meant to help people make games without the bloat of a game engine or the complexity of c++ and memory management. It has some simple but powerful functionality for making games (Like rendering and basic collision detection) but still has room so you can implment your own systems.

##  Isn't this just love2d?
At the current moment, yeah. It is basicly Love2d but diffrent. But I am hoping to change that. I want to implment some more game specific functionality (Built in A* pathfinding, tilemap loading, etc). What I am saying is that I want this to be more like flixel where it has a lot of game specifc functionality but is still bare bones enough to allow you to get your hands dirty.

##  Is this complete yet?
When was any open ~sause~ source project ever finished?

##  Todo
*  Tiled TMX or CSV loading
*  Built in collision response 
*  3d support (maybe)
*  Actually good examples
*  ~More basic shape rendering~
*  Built in sound
*  Windows build
*  Actually good examples
*  Wiki
*  API Documentation
*  Make a website
*  Setup Xmake (Not cmake, [xmake](https://xmake.io/))

##  How to build
*  First download [MINGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/), the [lua C lib](https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html), and the [Allegro development binaries](https://liballeg.org/) for the compiler.
*  If needed put the dev files in their respective folder
*  Put allegro_monolinth.dll into the root directory
*  Run make (or mingw32-make)
*  Run the executable
*  Or just ask me to build it for you though [email](mailto:michealtheratz@courvix.com) if you are lazy

Make sure to add yourself to the readme if you want. I can always do it for you too I guess.
